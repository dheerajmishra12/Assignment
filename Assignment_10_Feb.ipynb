        "\n",
        "Write mode ('w'): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file exists, it truncates (empties) the file before writing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Append mode ('a'): This mode opens the file for appending new information to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Binary mode ('b'): This mode is used for binary files. It is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., 'rb', 'wb', 'ab').\n",
        "\n",
        "Read and Write mode ('r+'): This mode opens the file for reading and writing. The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Write and Read mode ('w+'): This mode opens the file for reading and writing. It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, or creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Append and Read mode ('a+'): This mode opens the file for reading and appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode, but you can also read from it.\n",
