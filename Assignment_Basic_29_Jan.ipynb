        "Imperative/Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming, where you can write code in a step-by-step manner, specifying the sequence of actions to be performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python is an object-oriented programming language, allowing you to define classes and create objects with encapsulated data and behavior. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are key features of Python's OOP support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts, including the use of first-class functions, higher-order functions, and the ability to pass functions as arguments. Features like lambda functions and tools like the map, filter, and reduce functions contribute to functional programming support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Procedural Programming: Python allows you to write code in a procedural style, organizing functionality into procedures or functions that can be called sequentially.\n",

        "Scripting: Python is often used as a scripting language, allowing for the development of scripts to automate tasks or execute commands. It is widely used for system administration and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter determines the type at runtime, providing flexibility but also requiring careful consideration of variable types.\n",

        "Answer :- Memory management in Python is primarily handled by Python's memory manager, which operates behind the scenes to allocate and deallocate memory as needed. Python uses a combination of strategies, including reference counting and garbage collection, to manage memory efficiently. Here's how memory management works in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference Counting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses reference counting to keep track of how many references there are to an object in memory.\n",
        "Every Python object has a reference count that indicates the number of references pointing to it.\n",
        "When an object is created or referenced, its reference count is incremented. When a reference is deleted or goes out of scope, the reference count is decremented.\n",
        "When the reference count of an object reaches zero, meaning there are no more references to it, Python deallocates the memory associated with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Garbage Collection:\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a garbage collector to deal with objects that may form circular references or cycles, which can prevent objects from being deallocated even if their reference counts reach zero.\n",
        "The garbage collector in Python periodically runs to identify and collect objects that are no longer reachable or referenced by the program.\n",
        "Python's garbage collector uses a generational garbage collection algorithm, which divides objects into different generations based on their age. Younger objects are more likely to become garbage, so the garbage collector focuses on collecting them first.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Pool:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's memory manager uses a memory pool mechanism to efficiently allocate and manage memory for small objects.\n",
        "The memory pool preallocates memory in fixed-size chunks and manages these chunks using free lists to reduce the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's dynamic typing allows variables to reference objects of different types during execution. This flexibility comes at the cost of additional memory overhead to store type information and manage object references.\n",
        "Overall, Python's memory management system combines reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pooling to provide automatic memory management while minimizing memory leaks and optimizing performance. However, developers should still be mindful of memory usage and avoid unnecessary object creation and retention to ensure efficient memory usage in their Python programs.\n",
